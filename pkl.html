                correctAnswer: "The Cant",
                rationale: "The Cant is the mandatory, unbroken chanting of 'Kabaddi' during a raid, signaling the start and ensuring the raider doesn't take too long."

                correctAnswer: "Patna Pirates",
                rationale: "The Patna Pirates are famous for their dominant run, achieving a unique hat-trick of titles with Pardeep Narwal as their key player during that period."

                correctAnswer: "Ankle Hold",

                correctAnswer: "Do-or-Die raid",
                rationale: "The Do-or-Die rule forces action on the third raid, preventing too many empty raids and keeping the game dynamic."
